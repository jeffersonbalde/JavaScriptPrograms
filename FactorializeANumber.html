<!-- 

    FreeCodeCamp Task:

    Return the factorial of the provided integer.

    If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

    Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

    For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

    Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.
